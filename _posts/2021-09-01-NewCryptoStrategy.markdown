title: New Crypto Strategy Changed
subtitle:
categories:

I have a new stat/arb strategy in crypto that uses an adaptive state based system to identify MR opportunities
on small portfolios of coins.  I have identified ~1600 such portfolios across 200 coins, each of which is traded
as a strategy.  In practice I trade a portfolio of these strategies (which I term, "stratlets"), where the strategy
is defined as a dynamically weighted portfolio of these stratlets.

## Setup
While each stratlet is adaptive, adjusting internal parameters over time, there are some hyper parameters for the
following layers:

- __model__:
  * 5 dynamic parameters inferred over time
  * 1 fixed parameter
  * 1 parameter to be optimised
- __trading state machine__:
  * 3 parameters to be optimised
- __money management__:
  * 2 parameters to be optimised

In order to avoid overfitting, rather than optimising all 6 free parameters at once, took the following approach:

1. optimise each layer separately:  i.e. the model, trading, and MM are optimised separately
2. restrict the parameter values to a small # of discrete possibilities
3. perturbation analysis to make sure the "solution" is not overly sensitive to the optimal setting

I assumed 30bps in transaction costs and slippage in backtesting.  Trade profitability is quite high, so is not terribly
sensitive to transaction cost.  I am expecting < 10bps in transaction costs, so the remaining 20bps relates to execution slippage.

## Results
99% of the 1600 stratlets were __very positive out-of-sample__.  The remaining ~15 losing stratlets had easily identified
issues during the in-sample period, with low to negative performance in-sample.  These 15 portfolios also scored poorly
in terms of stationarity as well.

I observed a wide range of risk characteristics across the strategies (Sortino, Calmar, etc), so wanted to understand to
what degree the losing trades are correlated across stratlets.  __If the losses were highly correlated__ then bundling into a portfolio
would __not tend to improve the overall risk__.  Fortunately, as we shall see, the losses are __relatively uncorrelated__, leading to
__improved risk characteristics__ when trading a larger # of stratlets.

### Small Portfolio
Here is the performance of a small portfolio based on higher-liquidity stratlets ranked by the Calmar ratio within the validation period.
The individual stratlets have sortino's ranking from 0.6 to 3.2 within this small set, however __the effective Sortino for the
portfolio is higher__, at 4.3:

### Medium Portfolio
The risk characteristics improve even further to 10.3 with the larger top-25 portfolio:

So the good news is that the losses appear to be relatively independent across stratlets allowing us to average these out
with other profitable stratlets during the loss periods.

### Large Portfolio
I evaluated a portfolio based solely on the sortino seen within the training period, selecting stratlets with sortino > 3.
(selecting ~600 stratlets).  Note that the validation period was not used in portfolio
selection, providing a longer unseen period, from late March to current:

This appears to an excellent result, with a Sortino of 22.4 and 4682% return.  However, the return seems __too good to be true__,
and it is.  This result __assumes__ we can __execute in size__ (and at equal size) across stratlets.   In reality, scaling up
this strategy would underweight the majority of stratlets and overweight a smaller set with higher liquidity (the 
lower liquidity stratlets have higher returns than the highly liquid ones).

## Notes
1. I have not accounted for execution failures (for example missed legs)
   * will have to see how this plays out in live
2. Many of these stratlets are liquidity constrained, so the actual return when size adjusted will be lower.
   * the lowest liquidity portfolios can only handle, maybe, 10K / trade, while the highest, potentially a few
     million.
3. Live performance might degrade by 3 - 5x
   * due to the above considerations
4. The nature of stat/arb is that over time, the market will become more efficient
   * so I expect that the profitability of the strategy will diminish over time.
