title: Stable Coin Minting & Momentum

A friend of mine (thanks Adal) suggested that I look at other stable coins, again observing the relationship between 
coin issuance and momentum.  Given that Circle (USDC) and Binance coin (BUSD) are widely traded, focused on these
two coins.

Binance coin is newer than Circle, so I only have history for BUSD from late 2019.  However, will compare the signal
from these coins for events in 2020.  

## 2020 Covid Bounce
Here is the combined signal for USDC and BUSD during the covid bounce (this looks like a better read than USDT):

## 2020 Q4 Momentum
USDC and BUSD accumulation is in advance of Q4 momentum:

## Conclusions
Analyzing issuance of stable coin gives us a view on buying interest.  A good signal would blend information from
both of these coins (perhaps looking at the cross-correlation of excitation).
