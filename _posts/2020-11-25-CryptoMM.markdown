title: Thoughts on Crypto Market Making

In the past have been a HFT market maker for FX and other traditional instruments, however have not investigated exchange-based 
market making in Crypto.  As I have proprietary signals applicable for Crypto, thought it would be worthwhile to investigate the 
difficulty of market making on crypto exchanges.

The crypto ecosystem and microstructure is quite different from FX and equities in the following ways:

- __extremely high transaction costs__ on many exchanges
  * for example the US spot exchanges charge out at 25bps maker / taker on the lowest volume tier
  * derivatives exchanges tend to charge a somewhat more reasonable 0 - 5 bps maker / 5bps taker, more or less
  * BitMEX is an exception, providing a 2.5bps rebate for maker trades, though charges 5bps for aggressive
    exits.
- __very tight inside spread__, where the spread is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than transaction costs
  * spreads are generally in fractions of a basis point (for example 0.3 bps on BitMEX)
  * the real spread for size is quite a bit wider, however much of the volume is provided near the BBO I believe.
  * whereas maker transaction costs may generally be 0, have to factor in taker transaction costs for situations 
    where a position needs to be aggressively liquidated.
- __trades directionally__ on short timescales
  * observation that trading tends to move in waves where is largely buys or sells for extended periods, much more often 
    than an even balance of buys and sells
- __high volatility__


Given the above, crypto MM requires a __somewhat different approach__. Instead of trying to __capture spread__, as one might do with
more traditional assets, consider trying to capture somewhat longer term mean-reversion cycles.


## Analysis
Examining the most recent year of tick data, did the following analysis:  assuming we have attracted a long (short) position
at the BBO: 

- what __% of the time can can one liquidate__ a long (short) position for a __K bps profit target__
  * for K = 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 bps
- __unrealized drawdown__ one would have to ride through to liquidate for a K bps target
  * 50% and 75% quantile (drawdown 50% and 75%)
- __time to liquidation__
  * how long does it take on average to liquidate a position for a K bps profit (Tcleared), 
- __cost of failure to hedge__ (rfailed)
  * return if position closed after 1hr (for 5bps, 10bps) or 2hrs for 25 - 50 bps targets


### 5bps target

/          | % liquidated | Tcleared (mins) | Drawdown 50% | Drawdown 75%   | rfailed

short      |    82.8%     |     9.6 mins    | 5.23 bps     | 10.95 bps      | -43.0 bps   |

### 10bps target

/          | % liquidated | Tcleared (mins) | Drawdown 50% | Drawdown 75%   | rfailed

short      |    81.9%     |     20.5 mins   | 5.23 bps     | 18.10 bps      | -46.4 bps   |

### 25bps target

/          | % liquidated | Tcleared (mins) | Drawdown 50% | Drawdown 75%   | rfailed
-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
long       |     62.0%    |      34.8 mins  | 44.1 bps     |  81.3 bps      | -34.5 bps   |
short      |    63.0%     |     34.7 mins   | 9.6 bps      | 25.2 bps       | -34.4 bps   |

### 50bps target

/          | % liquidated | Tcleared (mins) | Drawdown 50% | Drawdown 75%    | rfailed
-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
long       |     53.3%    |      81.1 mins  | 83.4 bps     |  140.0 bps      | -43.4 bps   |
short      |    54.6%     |     80.5 mins   | 17.0 bps     | 42.2 bps        | -44.4 bps   |


## Discussion
__At first glance the numbers look quite attractive__ with 80%+ hedge achieved for targets 10bps and below; However if one
considers the cost of outliers (i.e. the remaining 18% that failed to close), a naive strategy would be negative.
For example the 10bps target skirts at the boundary of profitability:

```
81.2% x 10 - 18.8% x 46.8 -> -0.68 bps / position
```

With a 2.5bps rebate on BitMEX, would lead to a __2 bps+ / position profit on average__, assuming passive entry and exit.  However,
with some additional intelligence should be able to do better.

Conditioning on various signals I have been able to __increase the profitable liquidation % to up to 97%__, however at the cost
of much lower volume.   Hence I think the approach needs to be one of:

1. a __dynamic hedge model__, where forecasted hedge target is variable 
   * the goal would be that the larger targets would absorb the impact of the left tail
   * I have built this sort of model before, however they are non-trivial
2. __conditionally enter the market__ passively when conditions have high probability outcomes
   * this might not be a high-volume strategy, rather very sporadic and selective
3. __access bi-directional flow__ (possibly off exchange) to get more natural crossing
   * reducing the holding time for a position reduces the magnitude of the right tails; that said, while the tails
     may be smaller, the relative ratio of tail size to positive P&L can still handicap such a strategy.
